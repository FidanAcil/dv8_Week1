// Task: Calculate the perimeter and area of the classroom!

/* 1) What will the application do?
1 Point : The application prompts the user to enter values of length and width of the classroom.
2 Points: The application displays the area and perimeter of that classroom. 

/* 2) Build Specifications:
1 Point: Assume that the rooms are perfect rectangles.
1 Point: Assume that the user will enter valid numeric data for length and width.
1 Point: The application should accept decimal entries. 

/* 3) Additional Requirements:
 1 Point:  For answering the Lab Summary when submitting to the LMS
-2 Points: if there are any syntax errors or if the program does not run (for example, in a Main method). 
 2 Points: The application classifies the room as small (up to and including 250 square feet), medium 
(more than 250 but less than 650 square feet, or large (650 square feet or more). 

/* Hint: 
Area = Length * Width
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)  
Volume = Length * Width * Height
SurfaceArea = 2 * (Length*Width + Length*Height +Width*Height)

/* 4) Extra Challenges:
1 Point: Calculate the volume of the rooms.
1 Point: Calculate the surface area of the rooms. */
